# TikTok Downloader

Website for downloading TikTok videos and slideshow without watermark.

Previously I build this using EJS for the template engine. But after spending 30+ hours watching the Vue3 course, I try to apply what I have learned so far. So I rewrite the front end using Vue. I try to use Vue and Tailwind more, I really like them both.

The frontend design itself same as the previous one, I add some animation and dark mode to make it looks cooler. To get the TikTok data I'm using [TikTokNoWatermarkApi](https://github.com/siyosu/TikTok-No-Watermark-API). 

For the previous version you can find it [here](./previous_version).
