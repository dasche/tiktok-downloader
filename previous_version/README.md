# TikTok Downloader

TikTok video and slideshow downloader, I create this project because I love watching TikTok videos. I can stay awake all night just because this one APP.

I'm using Express, EJS, TailwindCSS, and [TikTok No Watermark API](https://github.com/siyosu/TikTok-No-Watermark-API) to get the content data.
I'm new to Express and TailwindCSS, But I try both of them a few times before. Also, the more I dig deeper into TailwindCSS, the more I realized how little I know about CSS.

Overall this is a fun project, now I can just go to my website and paste the video URL to download some TikTok videos.
